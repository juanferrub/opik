## 🚀 New Features

- **Experiment Grouping**: Instantly organize and compare experiments by model, provider, or custom metadata to surface top performers, identify slow configurations, and discover winning parameter combinations. The new Group by feature provides aggregated statistics for each group, making it easier to analyze patterns across hundreds of experiments.
